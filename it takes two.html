        and Series S in March 2021. Like A Way Out, Hazelight's debut title, It Takes Two does not have a single-player

        It Takes Two is an action-adventure video game with elements from platform games. It is specifically designed for 
        split-screen cooperative multiplayer, which means that it must be played with another player through either local 
        or online play. The game features a large number of game mechanics from various video game genres.<br />These gameplay 
        mechanics are connected to the story and the theme of the level. For instance, in one level, Cody gains the ability 
        to rewind time, whereas May can replicate herself. Players have to cooperate with each other and utilize these 
        abilities in order to progress. The game also features a large number of minigames.

    <p>
        A video game developer is a software developer specializing in video game development – the process and related
        disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks
        to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design,
        art, testing, etc.<br /> Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support.
        Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games.
