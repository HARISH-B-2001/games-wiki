    </h2>
    <p>
        PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG
        Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were
        created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and
        expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute
        onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves.
        The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas
        to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.

        Battlegrounds is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale,
        a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose
        to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.
        Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the four maps, with areas of approximately 8 × 8
        kilometres (5.0 × 5.0 mi), 6 × 6 kilometres (3.7 × 3.7 mi), and 4 × 4 kilometres (2.5 × 2.5 mi) in size.The
        plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to
        eject and parachute to the ground.

        Development
    </h2>
    <p>
        The game's concept and design was led by Brendan Greene, better known by his online handle PlayerUnknown, who had
        previously created the ARMA 2 mod DayZ: Battle Royale, an offshoot of popular mod DayZ, and inspired by the 2000
        Japanese film Battle Royale.At the time he created DayZ: Battle Royale, around 2013, Irish-born Greene had
        been living in Brazil for a few years as a photographer, graphic designer, and web designer, and played video games
        such as Delta Force: Black Hawk Down and America's Army.The DayZ mod caught his interest, both as a realistic
        military simulation and its open-ended gameplay, and started playing around with a custom server, learning
        programming as he went along.

        Release
    </h2>
    <p>
        Bluehole used closed alpha and beta periods with about 80,000 players to gauge initial reaction to the gameplay and
        adjust balance prior to a wider release. Just prior to the early access phase on Steam, Bluehole opened a few
        servers and invited some popular live streamers of similar games to try it out as to start gaining interest.
        Early access for the Windows version launched on March 23, 2017.This period was planned to last approximately
        six months, originally aiming for a September 2017 release.In July 2017, Greene announced that they would
        need to extend the early access period by a few months, continuing to release updates on a regular basis, with plans
        to still release by the end of 2017, as committing to this original period "could hinder us from delivering a fully
        featured game and/or lead to disappointment within the community if the launch deadline is not met".
