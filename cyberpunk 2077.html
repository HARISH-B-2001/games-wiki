        About
    </h2>
    <p>
        Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. The story takes place
        in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe. Players assume the first-person perspective of a
        customisable mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking and machinery with options for melee and ranged
        combat.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game was developed using the REDengine 4 by a team of around 500 people, exceeding the number that worked on the
        studio's previous game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015). CD Projekt launched a new division in Wrocław, Poland, and
        partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to aid the production. Cyberpunk creator Mike
        Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves has a starring role. The original score was led by Marcin
        Przybyłowicz, featuring the contributions of several licensed artists.

        Development
    </h2>
    <p>
        Cyberpunk 2077 was developed by CD Projekt Red's studios in Warsaw and Kraków, while the Wrocław office devoted about
        forty people to research and development.It is based on Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk role-playing game franchise;
        Pondsmith started consulting on the project in 2012.He also appears in it as a character.The game drew
        its influences from the 1982 film Blade Runner, manga and anime series Ghost in the Shell, and video games System
        Shock (1994) and Deus Ex (2000). Pondsmith's follow-up to Cyberpunk V3.0, Cyberpunk Red, also made an impact on
        the lore.The game cost an estimated 1.2 billion Polish złoty (US$313 million) to develop, making it one of the
        most expensive games ever made.
