        Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter set in the near future.Players play as one of a
        set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world.In the main game mode,
        players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have
        unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills,
        deaths, or spike actions. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability"
        charge. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money
        based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any actions taken with the
        spike. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine
        guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons
        that have a shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player in order to be able to shoot accurately.
